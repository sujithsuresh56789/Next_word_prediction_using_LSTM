Overview
This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to build a next word prediction model. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for natural language processing tasks like predicting the next word in a sentence.

Features
LSTM Architecture: The core of the model is built on LSTM units, enabling the network to remember information over long sequences.

Tokenization: The input text is tokenized to convert words into numerical representations, facilitating the training process.

Embedding Layer: An embedding layer is employed to transform the tokenized input into dense vectors, capturing semantic relationships between words.

Training Pipeline: The model is trained on a dataset of text sequences, learning to predict the next word in a given context.

Usage
Data Preparation: Provide your text data and preprocess it using the included data preparation scripts.

Model Training: Use the training script to train the LSTM model on your preprocessed data.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, utilize the prediction script to generate next-word predictions based on input sequences.

Requirements
Python
TensorFlow (or other compatible deep learning library)
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation
